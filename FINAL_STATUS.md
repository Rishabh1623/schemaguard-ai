## 💡 Interview Talking Points

**Problem:**
"Schema drift in ETL pipelines causes silent data corruption and production failures."

**Solution:**
"Built an event-driven, agent-based system using 10+ AWS services that detects schema changes, analyzes impact with Amazon Bedrock, proposes governed remediation, validates in staging, and controls production execution."

**Results:**
"Prevents failures before execution, reduces incident response from hours to minutes, provides reusable pattern for governed data evolution."

**Technical Depth:**
"30+ AWS resources via Terraform, 5 Lambda functions, 15+ state Step Functions workflow, complete observability, enterprise security patterns."
